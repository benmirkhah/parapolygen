# Parametric Polygon Generator

Continuation of my <a href="https://github.com/benmirkhah/svgen">SVGEN</a> project, but in modular object oriented EcmaScript, and later TypeScript! 

As the name suggests, generating parametric designs is the focus this time, isntead of the random background designs of SVGEN.

SVGEN was a quick proof of concept for  creating decent looking generative art, and as such its parametric feature was and after thought without much contemplation for its architecture or user interface, hence a rewrite to address its shortcommings.

This is a work in progress, so far the following works...

<ul>
  <li>Random colors</li>
  <li>SVG Filters</li>
  <li>Bounding box</li>
  <li>Groups</li>
  <li>Grids (Radial, Spiral)</li>
  <li>Circles</li>
  <li>Points with 3 types of render options (circle, crosshair, x-mark)</li>
</ul>

Parametric iterators
<ul>
  <li>Alternating</li>
  <li>Incremental</li>
  <!-- <li>Exponential</li> -->
  <!-- <li>Geometrical</li> -->
  <!-- <li>Logarithmic</li> -->
</ul>

Comming soon...
<ul>
  <li>Grids (Cartesian, and more)</li>
  <li>Basic shapes</li>
  <li>Complex shapes</li>
</ul>
